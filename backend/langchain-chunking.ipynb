      "\n",
      "Using [user chat histories and business data](#business-data-vs-chat-message-data), Zep automatically constructs a [knowledge graph](#the-knowledge-graph) for each of your users. The knowledge graph contains entities, relationships, and facts related to your user. As facts change or are superseded, [Zep updates the graph](#managing-changes-in-facts-over-time) to reflect their new state. Using Zep, you can [build prompts](#how-zep-fits-into-your-application) that provide your agent with the information it needs to personalize responses and solve problems.

      "Your application sends Zep messages and other interactions your agent has with a human. Zep can also ingest data from your business sources in JSON, text, or chat message format. These sources may include CRM applications, emails, billing data, or conversations on other communication platforms like Slack.\n",

      "Zep fuses this data together on a knowledge graph, building a holistic view of the user's world and the relationships between entities. Zep offers a number of APIs for [adding and retrieving memory](#retrieving-memory). In addition to populating a prompt with Zep's memory, Zep's search APIs can be used to build [agentic tools](#using-zep-as-an-agentic-tool).\n",
      "\n",
      "The example below shows Zep's `memory.context` field resulting from a call to `memory.get()`. This is an opinionated, easy to use context string that can be added to your prompt and contains facts and graph entities relevant to the current conversation with a user. For more about the temporal context of facts, see [Managing changes in facts over time](#managing-changes-in-facts-over-time).\n",
      "\n",
      "Zep also returns a number of other artifacts in the `memory.get()` response, including raw `facts` objects. Zep's search methods can also be used to retrieve nodes, edges, and facts.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Memory Context\n",

      "  while handling changing relationships and maintaining historical context.\n",
      "</Card>\n",
      "\n",
      "Zep automatically constructs a knowledge graph for each of your users. The knowledge graph contains entities, relationships, and facts related to your user, while automatically handling changing relationships and facts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's an example of how Zep might extract graph data from a chat message, and then update the graph once new information is available:\n",
      "\n",
      "![graphiti intro slides](file:847af9ec-d7d5-4eb4-b0a5-f904881d81e9)\n",

      "\n",
      "## User vs Group graphs\n",
      "\n",
      "Zep automatically creates a knowledge graph for each User of your application. You as the developer can also create a \"group graph\" for memory to be used by a group of Users.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, you could create a group graph for your company's product information or even messages related to a group chat. This avoids having to add the same data to each user graph. To do so, you'd use the `graph.add()` and `graph.search()` methods (see [Retrieving memory](#retrieving-memory)).\n",
      "\n",
      "Group knowledge is not retrieved via the `memory.get()` method and is not included in the `memory.context` string. To use user and group graphs simultaneously, you need to add group-specific context to your prompt alongside the `memory.context` string.\n",
      "\n",
      "Read more about groups [here](/groups).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Managing changes in facts over time\n",
      "\n",
      "When incorporating new data, Zep looks for existing nodes and edges in graph and decides whether to add new nodes/edges or to update existing ones. An update could mean updating an edge (for example, indicating the previous fact is no longer valid).\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, in the [animation above](#the-knowledge-graph), Kendra initially loves Adidas shoes. She later is angry that the shoes broke and states a preference for Puma shoes. As a result, Zep invalidates the fact that Kendra loves Adidas shoes and creates two new facts: \"Kendra's Adidas shoes broke\" and \"Kendra likes Puma shoes\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Zep also looks for dates in all ingested data, such as the timestamp on a chat message or an article's publication date, informing how Zep sets the following edge attributes. This assists your agent in reasoning with time.\n",

      "Zep's knowledge graph powers its facts and memory capabilities. Zep's graph is built on [Graphiti](/graphiti/graphiti/overview), Zep's open-source temporal graph library, which is fully integrated into Zep. Developers do not need to interact directly with Graphiti or understand its underlying implementation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Zep's graph database stores data in three main types:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Entity edges (edges): Represent relationships between nodes and include semantic facts representing the relationship between the edge's nodes.\n",
      "2. Entity nodes (nodes): Represent entities extracted from episodes, containing summaries of relevant information.\n",
      "3. Episodic nodes (episodes): Represent raw data stored in Zep, either through chat history or the `graph.add` endpoint.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Working with the Graph\n",
      "\n",
      "To learn more about interacting with Zep's graph, refer to the following sections:\n",

      "\n",
      "The text type is designed for raw text data without a specific speaker attribution. This category includes content from internal documents, wiki articles, or company handbooks. It's important to note that Zep does not process text directly from links or files.\n",
      "\n",
      "The JSON type may be used to add any JSON document to Zep. This may include REST API responses or JSON-formatted business data.\n",

      "</Check>\n",
      "\n",
      "## Quick Start\n",
      "\n",
      "An end-to-end SDE example (in Python) can be found in the [Zep By Example repo](https://github.com/getzep/zep-by-example/blob/main/structured-data-extraction/python/sales_order.ipynb).\n",

      "\n",
      "## SDE vs JSON or Structured Outputs Mode\n",
      "\n",
      "Many model providers offer a JSON and/or Structured Outputs inference mode that guarantees the output will be well-formed JSON, or in the case of Structured Output, is valid according to a provided schema.\n",
      "\n",
      "However:\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "#### SDE's Preprocessing, Guided LLM Output, and Validation\n",
      "\n",
      "Zep uses a combination of dialog preprocessing, guided LLM output, and post-inference validation to ensure that the extracted data is in the format you expect and is valid given the current dialog. When using a structured Field Type (such as `ZepDate`, `ZepEmail`, `ZepRegex`), you will not receive back data in an incorrect format.\n",
      "\n",
      "While there are limits to the accuracy of extraction when the conversation is very nuanced or ambiguous, with careful crafting of field descriptions, you can achieve high accuracy in most cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Concurrent Extraction Scales Sub-Linearly\n",
      "\n",
      "SDE's extraction latency scales sub-linearly with the number of fields in your model. That is, you may add additional fields with low marginal increase in latency. You can expect extraction times of 400ms or lower when extracting fairly complex models for a 500 character dialog (which includes both message content and your Role and RoleType designations).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Defining Your Model\n",
      "\n",
      "To extract data with Zep, you will need to define a model of the data you require from a Chat History. Each model is composed of a set of fields, each of which has a type and description. Key to successful extraction of data is careful construction of the field description.\n",

      "\n",
      "The chatbot uses Zep to provide context-aware responses. Here's how it works:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Context Retrieval**: It retrieves relevant facts for the user's current conversation (session). Zep uses the most recent messages to determine what facts to retrieve.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **System Message**: It constructs a system message incorporating the facts retrieved in 1., setting the context for the AI's response.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Message Persistence**: After generating a response, it asynchronously adds the user and assistant messages to Zep. New Facts are created and existing Facts updated using this new information.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Messages in State**: We use LangGraph state to store the most recent messages and add these to the Agent prompt. We limit the message list to the most recent 3 messages for demonstration purposes.\n",

      "Graphiti builds dynamic, temporally-aware knowledge graphs that represent complex, evolving relationships between entities over time. It ingests both unstructured and structured data, and the resulting graph may be queried using a fusion of time, full-text, semantic, and graph algorithm approaches.\n",

      "With Graphiti, you can build LLM applications such as:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Assistants that learn from user interactions, fusing personal knowledge with dynamic data from business systems like CRMs and billing platforms.\n",
      "* Agents that autonomously execute complex tasks, reasoning with state changes from multiple dynamic sources.\n",

      "We were intrigued by Microsoft’s GraphRAG, which expanded on RAG text chunking by using a graph to better model a document corpus and making this representation available via semantic and graph search techniques. However, GraphRAG did not address our core problem: It's primarily designed for static documents and doesn't inherently handle temporal aspects of data.\n",

      "Graphiti is designed from the ground up to handle constantly changing information, hybrid semantic and graph search, and scale:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Temporal Awareness:** Tracks changes in facts and relationships over time, enabling point-in-time queries. Graph edges include temporal metadata to record relationship lifecycles.\n",
      "* **Episodic Processing:** Ingests data as discrete episodes, maintaining data provenance and allowing incremental entity and relationship extraction.\n",
      "* **Hybrid Search:** Combines semantic and BM25 full-text search, with the ability to rerank results by distance from a central node e.g. “Kendra”.\n",
      "* **Scalable:** Designed for processing large datasets, with parallelization of LLM calls for bulk processing while preserving the chronology of events.\n",
      "* **Supports Varied Sources:** Can ingest both unstructured text and structured JSON data.\n",

This aggregated score determines the final ranking, leveraging the strengths of each method for more accurate retrieval.\n",

      "**Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR)** is a search strategy that balances relevance and diversity in results. It selects results that are both relevant to the query and diverse from already chosen ones, reducing redundancy and covering different query aspects. MMR ensures comprehensive and varied search results by iteratively choosing results that maximize relevance while minimizing similarity to previously selected results.\n",

      "\n",
      "The chatbot uses Graphiti to provide context-aware responses in a shoe sales scenario. Here's how it works:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Context Retrieval**: It searches the Graphiti graph for relevant information based on the latest message, using the user's node as the center point. This ensures that user-related facts are ranked higher than other information in the graph.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **System Message**: It constructs a system message incorporating facts from Graphiti, setting the context for the AI's response.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Knowledge Persistence**: After generating a response, it asynchronously adds the interaction to the Graphiti graph, allowing future queries to reference this conversation.\n",
      "\n",
      "This approach enables the chatbot to maintain context across interactions and provide personalized responses based on the user's history and preferences stored in the Graphiti graph.\n",
